## Practicum Firedrill notes -- 2021

Then the Sahel in Africa is the region between the Sahara Desert and the Savanah. The UN describes the Sahel as a
[land of opportunities](https://www.un.org/africarenewal/sahel), but today it is in crisis. The region is in the midst of a refugee crisis
[UN Refugee Agency site for Sahel crisis](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/sahelcrisis)
and is seeing an uptick of jihadist violence.  The countries in the Sahel include Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, The Gambia, Guinea Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal.  

What are the economic factors that affect this troubled region?  Do they offer any hope for quelling the suffering and violence?


One source of information is the World Bank, which tracks both poverty -- see [Multidimensional Poverty Measure (MPM)](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037589/World-Bank-s-Multidimensional-Poverty-Measure)
and spending power -- see [International Comparison Program (ICP)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp).  

Spending power data is available by country here: [Data Bank ICP 2017](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/icp-2017).

World Bank Poverty data is available here:
 [Multidimensional Poverty Measure](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/multidimensional-poverty-measure)

 I have downloaded poverty data spreadsheets which are available on my [github](https://github.com/havilandw/Practicum-Firedrill-2021).
